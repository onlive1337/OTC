# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-09

### Added
- Local SQLite storage (otc.db) instead of JSON; automatic table creation and PRAGMA WAL.
- Global aiohttp ClientSession for the entire lifetime of the application; warming up the course cache at startup.
- Retries with exponential delay and parallelism limitation (semaphores) for HTTP requests to exchange rate providers.
- Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) cache mode for exchange rates.
- Healthcheck in Dockerfile.
- Anti-flood for Telegram logs; only ERROR messages are sent to the log chat.

### Changed
- Complete removal of JSON files; constants and calls related to JSON have been removed. docker-compose now mounts the ./data directory and uses DB_PATH=/app/data/otc.db.
- Centralized logging (basicConfig in main.py); duplicate basicConfig from modules removed.
- Number formatting: M/B abbreviations disabled for fiat currencies — now the full value is displayed with separators.

### Fixed
- Fixed the critical error “Session is closed” and other issues when receiving rates; added timeouts, retries, and value checks (no division by zero/KeyError).
- TelegramBadRequest handling: “message is not modified” is ignored when re-editing a message in settings.
- User and chat settings: if all currencies/cryptocurrencies are removed, defaults are no longer substituted, and the corresponding sections are hidden.
